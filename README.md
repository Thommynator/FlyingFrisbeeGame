# Flying Frisbee

With this little Ultimate Frisbee game I want to get more familiar with Unity.
The current state looks like this:


Camera and spotlights follows frisbee. Thrower can switch his throw hand (left/right). Throw angle can be adjusted to throw higher or lower.

Basic aim & throw functionality. Player can move while not holding the frisbee.
